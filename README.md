This is a Kotlin Android App for searching movies and series from the imdb Database and saving them to your favorites. Used technologies in this project are Room, Retrofit, Gson and MVVM.

## Planned features:

- adding different lists like: watched or want to watch
- rework the design of the UI to look a bit nicer

## Sources that helped me building this App:
